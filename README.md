# Street-View-House-Numbers-Recognition
Being able to accurately classify digits from real, unprocessed photographs of the world is a complicated problem. In this project, we address this problem in the form of classiﬁcation of street view house numbers. An eﬃcient solution to this problem is quite useful in several contexts such as geocoding and improving map services (more accurate maps) which is a task already largely performed by GoogleMaps. Here, we focus on solving this problem using convolutional neural networks. For that purpose, we construct a convolutional neural network with two hidden (convolution) layers and two fully connected layers. The focus in this project, besides good results (high test accuracy), is also in analyzing the eﬀect of diﬀerent dropout keep probabilities and diﬀerent batch sizes.
